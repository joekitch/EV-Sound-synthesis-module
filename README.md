# EV-Sound-synthesis-module
A system to give EV conversions some characteristic sound, designed for the CORVOLT project, but may eventually be abstracted

---

## Disclaimer

This is a very experimental system, and while not inherently dangerous, i don't claim any responsibility of any silly things someone might end up doing

---

## Backround

Evs tend to be labeled as boring, partially becasue they're so silent. 
This system is an attempt to remedy that by building a complex soundscape which matches the character of the car, a mix of entirely snyhetic sound and amplifying existing sounds

---

## Working principle

The general idea is to have a central audio processing node somewhere which listens on the main canbus for key values like throttle position, rpms, current speed, and meta values like "torque requested".

The audio processor needs to be based around a Shepard's Tone, which continuously rises or falls due to an auditory illusion
